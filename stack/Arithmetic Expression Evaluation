1. Polish notation (prefix notation) – 
It refers to the notation in which the operator is placed before its two operands. Here no parentheses are required, i.e., 

+AB 
2. Reverse Polish notation(postfix notation) – 
It refers to the analogous notation in which the operator is placed after its two operands. Again, no parentheses is required in Reverse Polish notation, i.e., 

AB+ 



Infix notation: (A-B)*[C/(D+E)+F]
Post-fix notation: AB- CDE +/F +* 



The procedure for getting the result is: 

Convert the expression in Reverse Polish notation( post-fix notation). 
Push the operands into the stack in the order they appear. 
When any operator encounters then pop two topmost operands for executing the operation. 
After execution push the result obtained into the stack. 
After the complete execution of expression, the final result remains on the top of the stack. 

For example – 

Infix notation: (2+4) * (4+6)
Post-fix notation: 2 4 + 4 6 + *
Result: 60
